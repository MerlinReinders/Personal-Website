                    <h2>Software Developement Intern</h2>
                    <p>My name is Merlin Reinders and at the current moment, I am a student pursuing a Bachelor of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. From a young age, I have always expressed a deep interest in technology, ranging both from the physical components which make up the devices we use to the software which drives them. One of my first true introductions to the more technical aspects of computers was the first desktop I built. This was an experience that resonated with me for years to come, and I can attribute it to the inception of the path I am following today. 
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>Having completed two years of the Computer Science program at UBC, I have had significant, professional exposure to Java, C, and C++ in addition to assembly as well as data structures and algorithms. While this time has certainly given me the opportunity to hone my skills, I have also begun to pursue various other projects outside of school. These include my personal website, which at this given moment incorporates elements of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, as well as several Python-based projects centering around language proficiency, machine learning, and data science, which also utilize R. All of these aforementioned works are explained in greater detail on the projects page. It is ultimately my goal to achieve a career either in either the sector of data science or full-stack development.</p>
